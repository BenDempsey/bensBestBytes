Here's my first go at a static website with links to more pages!

Hi All, while I've been studying ICT and Cyber Security I feel I didn't get enough website building experience.
I have done some website security and cloud website building but have never done it all right from the start, so here goes my new adventure!

Studies include-
Certificate III Information and Communications Technology online at TAFE Brisbane
Certificate IV Cyber Security online at TAFE Brisbane
TryHackMe various certificates, you can see them all by clicking a button on my homepage.

Currently I'm looking for IT work around Brisbane or Southside.

Have a good day all,
Cheers,
Ben
