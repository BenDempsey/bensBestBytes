    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Introducing Myself: Passionate IT Professional with a Customer Service Edge</h2>
    <p>Hello,<br>
    I’m excited to introduce myself as a dedicated professional with a rich background in customer service, administration, and sales-roles where I’ve honed my communication, organisation, and leadership skills, including shift management and staff training. Over the past few years, I’ve channelled my curiosity and drive for growth into the dynamic world of Information Technology and Cyber Security.</p>

    <h2>Career Transition: From Service to Information and Communications Technology and Cyber Security</h2>
    <p>To support my transition, I completed a Certificate III in Information and Communications Technology and a Certificate IV in Cyber Security through TAFE Queensland Online. My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my active participation on TryHackMe, where I’ve earned multiple certifications and ranked well into the top 1% of users, a testament to my determination, analytical thinking, and technical problem-solving abilities. The Red Team Capstone Challenge, in particular, was a highlight, pushing me beyond my comfort zone and strengthening my skills in offensive security.</p>

    <h2>Building Practical Experience</h2>
    <p>Recognising the importance of hands-on experience, I’ve been proactive in building my technical portfolio. I’ve developed and hosted this static website using HTML and CSS on GitHub, with plans to expand into JavaScript and dynamic web development. My practical projects include hardware installations, upgrades, repairs, trouble-shooting, Raspberry Pi builds, and scripting with Python and Bash/Nano. I’ve also launched my own domain: Ben’s Best Bytes (bensbestbytes.com) to offer local and remote IT support, with a Facebook business page ready for future outreach.</p>

    <h2>Personal Motivation and Values</h2>
    <p>On a personal note, I’m based south of Brisbane and am seeking to launch my IT career in a role that leverages my new skills and offers long-term growth. After 22 years with my current employer, I’m ready for a fresh challenge that is less physically demanding and more aligned with my passion for technology. My family is my pride, my partner and I have raised our children into independent, successful adults. I also have a strong sense of community, having volunteered with the State Emergency Service, and I look forward to contributing again when time permits.</p>

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer-centric mindset with a proven track record in service and communication with a diverse client base</li>
        <li>Technical proficiency in cyber security, IT support, and beginnings in web development fundamentals</li>
        <li>Self-motivation and adaptability, demonstrated by my career change and ongoing self-education</li>
        <li>Community spirit and teamwork, both in the workplace and through volunteering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m eager to bring my unique blend of experience, technical skills, and enthusiasm to like-minded people and those in need of IT and cyber security support. Watch this space for more!!!</p>
